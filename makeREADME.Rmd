>The R script called run_analysis.R has been created that
>>  1.  Checks the existance of/creates "data" folder under your working directory.
>>
>>  2.  Downloads and extracts the dataset file into "data" folder.
>>
>>  3.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
>>
>>  4.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
>>
>>  5.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
>>
>>  6.  Labeles the data set with descriptive activity names.
>>
>>  7.  Creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
        subject.
